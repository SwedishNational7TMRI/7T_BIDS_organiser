PyMP2RAGE is a lightweight Python package to fit T1 maps
and make unified T1-weighted images out of MRI data collected using
the MP2RAGE sequence.

See Marques et al. (2010) for more information about the sequence.

This code is based on open-source Matlab code published on the `Github <https://github.com/JosePMarques/MP2RAGE-related-scripts>`_.
