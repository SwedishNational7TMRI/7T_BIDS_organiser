# 7T BIDS organiser
Bash and python scripts to convert DICOM data from the 7T into [BIDS-organised](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) NIfTI data.

## Installation
This software is best used as a python package which is installed using `pip`. Recommended that you do this in a an isolated conda or virtual environment. To install, navigate to the main directory and execute
```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```

To download the necessary docker containers execute
```sh
shell download_docker.sh
```

After you have installed the python package you will have a set of tools available:
- `7Tbids_import_dicoms`: Takes dicoms from an unsorted `dicomdir` and puts them in a organised folder structure
- `7Tbids_nifti2bids`: Takes your data from dicom to bids validated structure with nifti files in the `rawdata` folder. This is done in two steps
    1. Call with option `--organize` to run `heudiconv` without conversion. This requires that you point to appropriate heuristics file. Generates `/rawdata/.heudiconv/sub-$sID/dicominfo.tsv` which is used to generate a relevant heuristic file for input to `heudiconv`.
    2. Call with option `--convert` to do the actual nifti conversion.
- `7Tbids_validate`: Used to validate your BIDS tree structure.


The following folder structure and conventions are assumed to be used
- Original dicoms in `dicomdir`. These are "raw" DICOMS exported from the 7T archive. This folder will be used as inputs to some scripts and can be located anywhere.
    - Your DICOM data might be stored with run numbers instead of subject ID. To do this mapping you can use a `study_key.tsv` file. See example in this repository.
- Your study directory is the path to where you want your study data to be stored.
- It is recommended to store your own study code in a specific directory, `code_dir`.
- Re-named and re-arranged dicoms will be stored in  `study_dir/sourcedata`, which is the BIDS sourcedata-folder
- BIDS-organised NIfTIs in `study_dir/rawdata`
- You need a heuristics file for `heudiconv`. This should be stored in your code folder. See the `misc` folder here in the repo for example.

To convert data from raw DICOMS to a BIDS valid structure with NIFTI files it is recommended to set up a shell script with the following structure.

```sh
STUDYDIR=<my_bids_dir>
CODEDIR=<my_code_dir>
DICOMDIR=<my_dicom_dir>

study_key=${STUDYDIR}/study_key.tsv
heuristics_file=7T049_CVI_heuristic.py # This is assumed to live in the CODEDIR

# dicomdir -> sourcedata
7Tbids_import_dicoms --dicom_dir=$DICOMDIR --study_dir=$STUDYDIR --id=S02 --key=$study_key

# Organize and analyze sourcedata folder
7Tbids_nifti2bids --study_dir=$STUDYDIR \
                  --code_dir=$CODEDIR --id S02 \
                  --heuristic_file=$heuristics_file \
                  --organize

# sourcedata -> rawdata
7Tbids_nifti2bids --study_dir=$STUDYDIR \
                  --code_dir=$CODEDIR --id S02 \
                  --heuristic_file=$heuristics_file \
                  --convert

# Validate rawdata
7Tbids_validate --study_dir=$STUDYDIR
```
